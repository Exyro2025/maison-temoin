# Maison Témoin

Maison Témoin is a construction-phase residential systems authority layer designed for high-value developers building at portfolio scale.

The service establishes a manufacturer-referenced baseline record **post–rough-in and prior to drywall**, identifying materially significant deviations early—when correction is routine and downstream warranty noise is avoidable.
